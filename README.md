This is a re-implementation of the mini branch of Tupl in an unsafe programming
language (Standard C++11).

If performance is superior, then this may turn into a feature complete
re-implementation of Tupl in idiomatic C++. The current effort is to complete a
proof of concept for the sake of analysis and will likely preserve Java'ish
nature of the API.
